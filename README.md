## Description

***AS SOMEONE who needs to have their car repaired, but don't know who to go to for help<br>
I WANT to be able to have an app where I can locate mechanics near me and find one that may have the specialization or skillset to help with my issue<br>
SO THAT I CAN save time and effort finding information or recommendations from multiple sources for where I should go***

When it comes to car issues, there are two types of car owners in this world:

1) People who refuse to go to a dealership for repair because they refuse to pay an arm and a leg
2) People whose car is out of warranty

This app answers the notorious question, "***Do you know someone who knows a mechanic who might know what's wrong with my car and can help?***"

This app is designed as a networking and servicing app to connect local mechanics and people in need of their services -- similar to Tinder or Skillshare.

## User Story
```
GIVEN a functional app and simple user face

WHEN I first load the app
THEN I am presented with a landing page explaining the use case for the app and can be redirected via buttons based on my intentions

***Mechanic UI/UX***
WHEN I click "Start offering your services!"
THEN I am presented with a sign-up page to create a profile as a mechanic, in which I am automatically redirected to my profile page where I can view/edit my personal information.

***Guest UI/UX***
WHEN I click on "Start looking for mechanics!"
THEN I am presented with a carousel to browse through that will list mechanics who have created accounts to offer their services
    or
THEN I am presented with an input field where I can enter a specific name of a mechanic for which I can "jump" to their profile directly

WHEN I click "See profile" on a mechanic's preview within the carousel
THEN I am presented with more detailed information about the mechanic

WHEN I need to pay a mechanic for services rendered
THEN I click on "Pay <mechanic name>" within a profile to be redirected to an inegrated, trusted, payment site where I can enter my card information and pay as needed (I will be notified of a successfull payment and directed back to the homepage when a payment is completed)
```
